# VS-Web-Clone
In the project, I undertook the task of cloning the website design of VS Code,
a popular code editor developed by Microsoft. The goal was to recreate the
visual appearance and layout of the official VS Code website, demonstrating
my proficiency in front-end web development and design skills.
